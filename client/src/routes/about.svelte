<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>
  BLOGIFY is a community of software developers getting together to help one
  another out. The software industry relies on collaboration and networked
  learning. We provide a place for that to happen.
</p>
<p>
  Our application is open source, meaning you can inspect every little detail of
  the code, or chip in yourself! We are working to make our platform available
  for anyone to stand up similar communities in any niche or passion.
</p>
<p>
  We believe in transparency and adding value to the ecosystem. We hope you poke
  around and like what you see!
